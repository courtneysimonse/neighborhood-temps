                <h3>Priority canopy neighborhoods</h3>
                <p>The Philly Tree Plan identifies seven areas of priority to support equity in canopy growth and management. Canopy growth in these areas will have the most significant impact on public health, wellbeing, and quality of life. Planning for canopy growth must happen in collaboration with the communities that live in these areas to reduce the potential for burden and increase benefit.</p>

                <h3>West Priority</h3>
                <p>
                  33,500 new trees needed to reach 30% canopy
                </p>
                <p>
                  This area is characterized by two-story row homes with small front and rear yards. The commercial corridors and most residential streets are 2-4 lanes with only a few one way streets and alleys. Many existing trees are over mature and near the end of their life. Cobbs Creek Park is a significant asset to this community, providing access to a large contiguous forest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To achieve the 30% canopy goal, strategies must be identified for new tree planting along the streets, in residential yards, and to replace aging or dying trees. Over the past decade, street trees have experienced the greatest percentage of loss with a 15% decline from 2008-2018.

                  This area is characterized by 2-3 story row homes, commercial corridors with surface parking, and large industrial areas. There are no parks or recreation centers within the study area although there are some nearby.

                <p>
                  To achieve the 30% canopy goal strategies must be identified for new tree planting along the streets, in residential yards, and in collaboration with landlords and other commercial or industrial land owners. Opportunities for green corridors that connect the neighborhood to Cobbs Creek Park, Bartramâ€™s Garden or other green spaces should be considered.

                  This area is characterized by 1-2 story homes with front stoops and small rear yards or alleys. Buildings are densely built along narrow streets with narrow sidewalks. It is adjacent to areas of air pollution including highways and industry. This area has the lowest total canopy cover in the city at only 5.5% and very high development pressure.

                  To achieve the 30% canopy goal strategies must be identified for new tree planting along the streets, in residential yards, and in collaboration with landlords and other commercial or industrial land owners. There are also opportunities to increase canopy in collaboration with Philadelphia Housing Authority and within existing Parks.

                <!-- <p>
                  This area encompasses many different neighborhoods. It is characterized by row houses and areas of high vacancy creating a burden canopy in vacant lots. There are several large natural areas within proximity including Hunting Park and Fairmount Park, but opportunities for access to parks within the area are limited.

                  To achieve the 30% canopy goal strategies must be identified for new tree planting along the streets, in residential yards, and in collaboration with landlords and other commercial or industrial land owners. Given the quantity of schools, opportunities to collaborate with schoolyard greening efforts should also be considered.

                  To achieve the 30% canopy goal strategies must be identified for new tree planting along the streets, in residential yards, and in collaboration with landlords and other commercial or industrial land owners.
